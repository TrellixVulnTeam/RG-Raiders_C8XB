    *  account/wallet from your blockchain account provider and returning a fixed length
    *  string of the signature by hashing it. This function does not need to consume
    *  accountId/address if your provider knows that value at later point of the interaction.

    *  function in https://github.com/ceramicnetwork/js-3id-blockchain-utils, if you
    *  are using the standard account signing interface in your network/blockchain.

    *  please open an issue there, so we can add shared support for your network.
